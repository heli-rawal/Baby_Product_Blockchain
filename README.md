-> Consensus algorithm <br>
-> Replication <br>
-> Proof of Work<br>

## How to run
#### Start nodes
```js
FLASK_APP=server.py flask run --port=5001
```

```js
FLASK_APP=server.py flask run --port=5002
```

#### Register nodes
Include all other nodes in the JSON file other than the node you're already on. Uses proof of work and forges a new block.
For registering node 5002 on node 5001: 
```js
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5001/nodes/register -d @register-node5001.json --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

For registering node 5001 on node 5002: 
```js
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5002/nodes/register -d @register-node5002.json --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Register a new item as a manufacturer node
```js
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:5001/register -d @entry.json --header "Content-Type: application/json"

{
	"upc": "123",
	"product":"MEGNYA Leather Baby Moccasins",
	"link": "https://www.amazon.com/MEGNYA-Leather-Moccasins-Toddler-ZH0003-Brown-12-5/dp/B07BBVPSPW/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1525936891&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=baby+shoes&psc=1",
	"quantity": "90",
	"price":"18.99",
	"manufacturer": "MEGNYA"
}

```

#### Replicate/update nodes
To replicate all new changes (such as the ones made on 5001) on node 5002:
```js
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5002/nodes/resolve
```
To replicate all new changes (such as the ones made on 5002) on node 5001:
```js
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/nodes/resolve
```
Run on all nodes that have not been updated.

#### Transfer ownership of a product : UPDATE THIS JSON
Checks to see that the original owner actually has the product or not. Also checks to see if a product exists with that ID.
```js
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/transfer

{
	"upc": 123123,
	"old_owner": "Aditi", 
	"new_owner": "Femi"
}

```

#### Get the updated blockchain to see updates
```js
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/chain
```

#### Get a specific transaction with transaction ID (returns block that contains the transaction)
```js
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/transaction/<transaction_ID>
```

#### Get a specific product with product ID (returns block that contains the product)
Returns an error statement if a product with that ID does not exist.
```js
curl -i -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/product/<product_ID>
